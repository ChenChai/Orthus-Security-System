ESP8266 MAC Address: BC:DD:C2:15:04:B9

TODO: upload Arduino Pin diagrams for direct mode and through-arduino mode.

How we intend to connect to the ESP8266 is through serial connections.

Initially, we bypassed the Arduino Mega completely and used a command line input from the desktop computer to access the ESP8266. We managed to connect to a hotspot from a phone. This allowed us to retrieve the ESP8266's MAC address, which we will send to IST to allow the ESP8266 to connect to wifi anywhere on campus using "uw-wifi-setup-no-encryption".

How to access the command line:
Connect the ESP8266 to the Arduino using the diagrams
Install the ESP8266 library:

http://arduino.esp8266.com/versions/2.4.2/package_esp8266com_index.json

Paste this in the form under preferences, then scroll to the bottom of the libraries manager and install the latest version.

Next, go to Arduino IDE -> Tools -> Board and select "Generic ESP8266 Module"
Then, go to Tools -> Serial Monitor to input commands. Try "AT" and see if that works.





Now, we will be using the Arduino
